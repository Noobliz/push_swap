# push_swap

**An algorithmic project focused on sorting data with a limited set of operations, optimizing for both efficiency and minimal instruction count.**

## Objectives
- Sort a stack of integers using only a defined set of operations (push, swap, rotate, reverse rotate).
- Develop and implement efficient sorting algorithms under strict operational constraints.
- Optimize performance both in terms of speed and number of moves.
- Manage memory dynamically and prevent leaks in a highly constrained environment.

## Skills developed
- Deep understanding of sorting algorithms and their adaptations to specific constraints.
- Advanced algorithmic thinking: problem decomposition, optimization strategies (greedy methods, small dataset specific strategies).
- Careful dynamic memory management and protection against undefined behavior.
- Writing structured, modular, and highly optimized C code compliant with the 42 coding standards.
